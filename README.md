# Python SQLite3 Operations & Practice

This repository contains a comprehensive Python script demonstrating fundamental and intermediate database operations using the built-in `sqlite3` library. 

It serves as a practical guide to relational databases, covering everything from table creation to complex aggregate functions.

## 🚀 Features & SQL Concepts Covered

- **Database Setup:** Creating a local database (`students.db`) and connecting to it via Python.
- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Creating tables (`Students`, `Courses`) with primary keys, unique constraints, and data types.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** - Inserting multiple records efficiently (`executemany`).
  - Updating records (`UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE`).
  - Deleting records (`DELETE FROM ... WHERE`).
- **DQL (Data Query Language):**
  - Basic queries (`SELECT`, `WHERE`).
  - Sorting data (`ORDER BY ASC/DESC`).
  - Limiting results (`LIMIT`).
  - Pattern matching (`LIKE`).
  - Logical operators (`OR`, `AND`, `!=`).
- **Aggregate Functions:** `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`,
